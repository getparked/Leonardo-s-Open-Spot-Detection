# Get-Parked-Leonardo-s-Detection-Code
GitHub Repository for Leonardo's Open Spot Detection Code with main files, pictures, support files and tutorial presentation

This Repository holds all the files needed to set up Get Parked's Open Spot Detection Code in a parking lot.
This code is meant to be run from a processor with access to images, hopefully of a parking lot.

Libraries:
  Serial
  OpenCV
  NumPy
  
Versions:
  Python 3.11.6
  OpenCV 4.8.0

  Along with the detection system, these files contain snippets for data transmission as it is part of the Get Parked's service scope, but it will not
  be covered here.
  
  Special Thanks to all of Camosun's Personel, my parents and to the z fighters.
